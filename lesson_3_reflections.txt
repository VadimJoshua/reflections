When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work
local?

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git
automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

use one instead of another?

    Forks are for copy someone's project. Clones are for make copy of current

What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote

How would you collaborate without using Git or GitHub?  What would be easier,
and what would be harder?

    Without using Git/GitHub we need to manually exchange files via email and
    look through carefully fix errors.

When would you want to make changes in a separate branch rather than directly in
master?  What benefits does each approach have?
