How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see the bug that
was introduced?

    Minuses and pluses show me the lines where the changes exist.

How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more
efficient programmer in the long term?

    It helps to see the way I changed my decisions while creating code.

What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a
commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google
docs does?

    The pros is that committed changes are meanful vs many minor versions in Google Docs.
    The cons is that I can forget to save at some important milestone.

Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple
files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?

    There can be many connected files in complex projects therefore new state of dependencies
    must be saved at one time.

How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?

    By compare differencies made in different commits' IDs.

How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that
could break something?

    It helps to see the history of changes more deep and in conjunction with other dependencies.

Now that you have your workspace set up, what do you want to try using Git for?

    For publishing my projects.
